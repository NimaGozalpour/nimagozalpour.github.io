  title={Forecasting Stock Market Price Using Deep Neural Networks},
  author={Gozalpour, N. and Teshnlab, M.},
  abstract={Investors in the stock market expect to make their profits, meaning they are looking for a profit by buying a share at low prices and selling it to the highest level, which requires stock price prediction. Significant challenges arise due to the non-linear and chaotic nature of stock markets when predicting prices in time series. In this research, unsupervised methods were used for the reduction of the input dimension and creating indicators. In the next step, the output of the unsupervised model was fed as input into the Jordan Recursive Neural Network(JRNN) to predict the closing price of the upcoming day. To illustrate the functionality and superiority of the proposed algorithm, data from three different and challenging stock symbols of Nasdaq were used. Ultimately, the model was evaluated with mean square error and mean absolute percentage error.},

  title={Interdependent Network Formation Game Using TLBO Algorithm},
  author={Abolghasemi, M., and Gozalpour, N., and Nikoofard, A., and Ghasemi, A.},
  abstract={The increasing interconnections between different infrastructures has led to the emergence of Interdependent networks, and therefore, the optimal design of these types of networks is very crucial to enhance the resilience and efficiency of these systems. The purpose of this article is to study a two-player game-theory model in which the designers of two interconnected networks intend to maximize the connectivity of their system having incomplete information about each other. To do this, each of them generates a series of formations, according to the constraints and conditions of the problem, and improves them sequentially to a maximum extent. For this purpose, the TLBO algorithm has been used to solve the optimization problem which after few steps, reaches the Nash equilibrium point and obtains the final formation of the network.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
